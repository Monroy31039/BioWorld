Title: A Curated Collection of Biodiversity and Species Datasets and Utilities
Version: 0.1.0
Maintainer: Juan David Monroy <monroyjuandavid773@gmail.com>
Description: Provides a curated collection of biodiversity and species-related datasets (birds, plants, reptiles, turtles, mammals, bees, marine data and related biological measurements), together with small utilities to load and explore them.
    The package gathers data sourced from public repositories (including Kaggle and well-known ecological/biological R packages) and standardizes access for researchers, educators, and data analysts working on biodiversity, biogeography, ecology and comparative biology.
    It aims to simplify reproducible workflows by packaging commonly used example datasets and metadata so they can be easily inspected, visualized, and used for teaching, testing, and prototyping analyses.
